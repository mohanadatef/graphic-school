## Solution Presentation (10-15 Minutes)

### Present Solution

**Based on identified needs, present relevant features:**

#### If They Need Flexibility:

"Graphic School 2.0 offers the most flexible course structure in the market. You can have multiple instructors per course and multiple groups, which means you can run parallel classes of the same course. This is perfect for [their use case]."

#### If They Need a Website:

"Unlike other platforms, Graphic School includes a complete public website with a built-in CMS. You can customize everything—branding, colors, fonts, content—without needing a developer. This saves you thousands in website development costs."

#### If They Need Simplicity:

"Our setup wizard gets you up and running in under 30 minutes. The interface is intuitive, so your team will be productive from day one. No complex training required."

#### If They're Cost-Conscious:

"At $149/month for our Professional plan, you get unlimited courses, groups, and up to 500 students. Compare that to [competitor] at $400/month, and you're saving over $3,000 per year."

### Demonstrate Value

**Show specific benefits:**

- "You mentioned [pain point]. With Graphic School, you can [solution], which will save you [time/money]."
- "Based on your [number] students, you'll save approximately [X] hours per month on [task]."
- "The integrated website alone would cost $[X] to build separately."

## Objection Handling (As Needed)

### Price Objection

**Response:**
"I understand budget is a concern. Let's look at the ROI: You mentioned spending [X] hours per month on [task]. At [hourly rate], that's $[X] per month in time. Our platform reduces that by 70%, saving you $[X] monthly. The platform pays for itself."

**Response:**
"Absolutely. What specific concerns do you have? Let me address those now so you have all the information you need."

### "We're Too Small"
