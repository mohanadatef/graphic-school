# Objection Handling Guide

## Overview

This guide provides responses to common objections during sales conversations, helping convert prospects into customers.

## Common Objections

### 1. "It's Too Expensive"

#### Understand the Concern

**Questions to Ask:**
- "What's your current budget?"
- "What are you currently spending on [similar solutions]?"
- "What would make the price acceptable?"

#### Response Strategy

**Show ROI:**
"You mentioned spending [X] hours per month on [task]. At [hourly rate], that's $[X] in time. Our platform reduces that by 70%, saving you $[X] monthly. The $149/month pays for itself."

**Compare Value:**
"Let's compare: [Competitor] costs $400/month. We're $149/month—that's $3,000/year savings. Plus, you get an integrated website, which would cost $5,000+ to build separately."

**Flexible Options:**
"We have a Starter plan at $49/month if you want to start smaller. You can always upgrade as you grow."

**Payment Terms:**
"We offer annual billing with 20% discount, bringing it down to $119/month. That's even better value."

### 2. "We're Happy with Our Current System"

#### Understand the Situation

**Questions to Ask:**
- "What do you like most about [current system]?"
- "What would make you consider switching?"
- "Are there any limitations you're experiencing?"

#### Response Strategy

**Acknowledge:**
"I understand you're satisfied with [current system]. That's great. Many of our customers were happy with their previous system too, but they switched for [specific benefits]."

**Find Gaps:**
"Does [current system] handle [specific need]? With Graphic School, you get [benefit] plus [additional benefit]."

**Low-Risk Trial:**
"Since you're happy where you are, there's no pressure. But would you be open to a 14-day free trial? No risk, no commitment. You can see if it offers anything your current system doesn't."

### 3. "We Need to Think About It"

#### Understand the Hesitation

**Questions to Ask:**
- "What specifically do you need to think about?"
- "What information would help you decide?"
- "What concerns do you have?"

#### Response Strategy

**Address Concerns:**
"I want to make sure you have all the information you need. What specific concerns do you have? Let me address those now."

**Create Timeline:**
"I understand you need time. When would be a good time to follow up? I can also send you a detailed proposal with everything we discussed."

**Trial Offer:**
"While you're thinking, why not start a free trial? No commitment, full access. You can explore it at your own pace and see if it's a good fit."

**Identify Blockers:**
"Is there anything specific that's preventing you from moving forward? I can help address that."

### 4. "We're Too Small"

#### Understand the Concern

**Questions to Ask:**
- "How many students do you have?"
- "How many courses?"
- "What are your growth plans?"

#### Response Strategy

**Right-Sized Solution:**
"Actually, our Starter plan at $49/month is perfect for smaller institutions. You get up to 5 courses, 10 groups, and 100 students. That's designed for smaller operations."

**Growth Path:**
"The great thing is you can start small and scale as you grow. Many of our customers started with 20 students and now have 200+. You only pay for what you need."

**Value Even for Small:**
"Even with 50 students, you'll save hours per month on administrative tasks. The time savings alone make it worthwhile."

### 5. "We Don't Have Time to Implement"

#### Understand the Concern

**Questions to Ask:**
- "What's your timeline?"
- "What's the biggest implementation concern?"
- "How much time can you allocate?"

#### Response Strategy

**Quick Setup:**
"Our setup wizard gets you up and running in 30 minutes. Many customers are fully operational within a day. It's designed to be fast and easy."

**Support Available:**
"We provide full setup support. I can help you get started, or we can schedule a setup call. You don't have to do it alone."

**Phased Approach:**
"We can start with the basics and add more as you have time. You don't need to set up everything at once."

**Time Savings:**
"Think of it this way: Spending 2 hours on setup saves you 10+ hours per month going forward. It's an investment that pays off immediately."

### 6. "We Need Custom Features"

#### Understand the Need

**Questions to Ask:**
- "What specific features do you need?"
- "Are these must-haves or nice-to-haves?"
- "What's the use case?"

#### Response Strategy

**Check Existing Features:**
"Let me show you what we already have. Many 'custom' features are actually standard with us. For example, [feature] is included."

**Custom Development:**
"We do offer custom development at $150/hour. But first, let's see if our existing features meet your needs. Often, what seems custom is actually achievable with our flexible system."

**Roadmap:**
"That feature is on our roadmap for [timeline]. Would that work for you, or do you need it sooner?"

**Workarounds:**
"While we don't have that exact feature, here's how you can achieve the same result with our current system: [explanation]."

### 7. "We're Not Technical"

#### Understand the Concern

**Questions to Ask:**
- "What technical tasks concern you?"
- "Do you have IT support?"
- "What's your comfort level?"

#### Response Strategy

**Ease of Use:**
"That's exactly why we built Graphic School to be easy. No technical knowledge required. The interface is intuitive, and we have step-by-step guides for everything."

**Support:**
"We provide comprehensive support. Email, documentation, video tutorials—we're here to help. Many non-technical customers use it successfully."

**Setup Help:**
"I can help you set it up personally. We'll do it together, and you'll see how simple it is."

**Training:**
"We offer training sessions to get your team comfortable. Most people are productive within a day."

### 8. "We Need to Talk to Our Team"

#### Understand the Process

**Questions to Ask:**
- "Who needs to be involved?"
- "What's the decision process?"
- "When can we schedule a group demo?"

#### Response Strategy

**Facilitate Discussion:**
"Absolutely. I can join that meeting to answer questions. Or I can provide materials you can share with your team."

**Group Demo:**
"Let's schedule a group demo. I can show everyone the platform and answer questions together. When works for your team?"

**Provide Materials:**
"I'll send you a proposal, feature comparison, and demo video you can share with your team. That way everyone has the information they need."

**Follow Up:**
"When should I follow up after your team discussion? I'm happy to answer any questions that come up."

### 9. "We're Already Using [Competitor]"

#### Understand the Situation

**Questions to Ask:**
- "How long have you been using [competitor]?"
- "What works well?"
- "What are the main frustrations?"

#### Response Strategy

**Acknowledge:**
"[Competitor] is a good platform. Many of our customers came from [competitor] because they needed [specific benefit we provide]."

**Differentiate:**
"Here's how we're different: [specific differentiator]. Does that address any of the limitations you're experiencing?"

**Low-Risk Trial:**
"Since you're already set up with [competitor], there's no rush. But would you be open to a free trial? You can compare side-by-side and see if we offer anything better."

**Migration Support:**
"If you do decide to switch, we can help with data migration. Many customers have made the switch smoothly."

### 10. "We Need to See It First"

#### Response Strategy

**Immediate Demo:**
"Absolutely. I can give you a live demo right now, or we can schedule a time that works better. What would you prefer?"

**Free Trial:**
"Even better—you can try it yourself with our 14-day free trial. Full access, no credit card required. You can explore everything at your own pace."

**Video Tour:**
"I can send you a video walkthrough that shows all the key features. Would that help?"
